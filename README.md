# E-Yantra-Cosmo-Logistic

This Project was a part of E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2022-2023 under the theme 'Cosmo Logistic'. We were among the top 15 teams out of 348 nationwide teams.

This project revolves around ROS2. Here, a UR5 Robotic Arm and an ebot work in collaboration to sort and prepare packages for delivery in a warehouse. We used ROS2, Gazebo, MOVEit, Nav2, Computer Vision, Python. We tested our algorithm in Gazebo, refined it, and then implemented it in actual hardware present in a warehouse at IIT Bombay
